# Security-Surveillance
This project is very good for the peoples who mostly leave their desktop pcs for few hours and someone is trying to access their pcs in their absence.

When we leave the desktop or laptop it is locked automatically and some kids always try to unlock it. Now using this we can 
check out who has tried to unlock it.
Whenever the window is locked , your webcam starts capturing the person in front of the screen and when you unlock it, it will doesn't display anything and just saves the video with the time and date as the name of the video. So in future you can see who hass tried to access your desktop in your absence.

In future i will try to include the networking phase in it also.
